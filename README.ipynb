    "This project is an implementation of a sensor fusion algorithm based on Unscented Kalman filter in order to estimate the position of moving car in constant circular motion and control hunter car to catch it.\n",

    "### Project Goals\n",
    "This project aims to solve the non-linearity problem in moving object by using the constant turn rate and velocity magnitude motion model(CTRV) in order to predict position of car after time `t`. The strategy is by using the trigonometry and circular motion the center of the runaway car can be calculated by taking 3 points on the circular path. The time between taking each point `dt=.1`. then I controlled the hunter car to the center. the distance from the center to any point on the circle path are equal, hence I calculated the time `t` heading the hunter car after distance radius then predict the position of the runaway car after time `t`.\n",

    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The UKF can predict the position of object after time `t` accurately and the hunter car can catch the run away car if the motion is known but more examination required if the motion of the object unknown.\n",
